        <h1>Digital Store</h1>
        <spam>The digital store is a modern, cloud-based set of solutions that enables retailers to integrate their store infrastructure and consumer-engagement technologies, connecting the digital and physical worlds to deliver seamless, cross-channel experiences that will help them thrive with today’s hyperconnected consumer.</spam>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h1>Five ways retailers and brands can create confidence and build resilience</h1>
        <h2>1. Earn customer trust</h2>
        <spam>Safety is the biggest priority for consumers these days. Retailers need to respond appropriately and provide assurance that all the necessary precautions are in place before the consumer enters the store. Retailers who operate in multiple countries will need to implement a different set of requirements per region, all while maintaining the same brand experience.</spam>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Study your retail customer</h2>
        <spam>In the first couple of weeks of reopening after pandemic-related shutdowns, retailers saw transactional shopping as consumers met their pent-up desire to shop or replenished depleted household items. Within two weeks of an opening, however, customers wanted to return safely to the relational, social experience of retail. It’s too early to tell how the trend will develop, but more than likely, customers will return to a hybrid model. And that’s a good thing: McKinsey’s research confirms that customers who shop across channels are twice as profitable to the retailer. By segmenting customer data and delivering relevant offers, retailers can orchestrate the return of consumer demand with a more flexible fulfillment model.</spam>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3. Agile everythin</h2>
        <spam>Staff, stores, inventory, orders, and the supply chain need to be agile and responsive. Technology can automate and scale business process, providing flexibility to adjust and adapt customer journeys. With a level of operational transparency, retailers obtain a single view of order, inventory, and customer and can respond more effectively to protect margins, regardless of the shifting open-close restrictions governing businesses and consumers around the world.</spam>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>4. Empower retail with insight</h2>
        <spam>Yes, the data is changing. Today’s consumer has unlimited access to information—more information than many store associates have access to while at work. Level the playing field for your team and empower the store associate with the tools and the data needed to create a superior experience. Tap into artificial intelligence and machine learning to anticipate the needs of the consumer and elevate the experience for your customer and team, driving new levels of satisfaction for both.</spam>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>5. Establish customer communication channels</h2>
        <spam>Retailers need to implement localized communications. If your retail operation is shut down in one location, communicate with customers at a local level to redirect demand to alternate locations and channels. As an example, if the contagion rises in London again, the city will likely leave shops open in the Southeast. With technology in place, retailers can communicate more specifically, introduce new opportunities to fulfill demand, and contain the impact on their business.</spam>
